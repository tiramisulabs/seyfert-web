## The Little Things

Not every release needs a headline feature. Sometimes the best updates are the ones that remove friction from your daily workflow.

**Seyfert v3.2.0** is a love letter to developer experience.

---

## `waitFor`: Await Specific Components

Collectors are powerful, but sometimes you just want to wait for *that one button click*:

```ts
const interaction = await collector.waitFor(
  (i) => i.customId === 'confirm' && i.user.id === userId,
  { timeout: 30000 }
);

if (interaction) {
  await interaction.reply({ content: 'Confirmed!' });
}
```

No more callback soup. Just clean, linear async code.

---

## Awaitable Text Command Responses

`deferReplyResponse` and `reply` for text commands are now properly awaitable:

```ts
// Before: Fire and forget
ctx.deferReplyResponse();

// After: Wait for it
await ctx.deferReplyResponse();
await ctx.reply({ content: 'Processing complete!' });
```

Better control flow. Fewer race conditions.

---

## RegExp Custom IDs

`CommandComponent` now accepts regular expressions for `customId` matching:

```ts
import { ComponentCommand, type ComponentContext } from 'seyfert';

export default class ProductHandler extends ComponentCommand {
  componentType = 'Button' as const;
  customId = /^product-\d+$/; // Matches product-1, product-42, etc.

  run(ctx: ComponentContext<typeof this.componentType>) {
    const productId = ctx.customId.split('-')[1];
    // Handle any product-{number} button
  }
}
```

One handler for many buttons. DRY and powerful.

---

## Thread Management

New utility for fetching active threads:

```ts
const activeThreads = await client.threads.listGuildActive(guildId);
```

No more workarounds to find what threads are currently active.

---

## Stability Improvements

### Worker Heartbeat

Workers now maintain a heartbeat to keep connections alive. No more mysterious disconnections in long-running worker processes.

### Bug Fixes

- **Thread `parentId`** now correctly returns the parent channel ID (was `undefined`)
- **Gateway properties** properly propagate from parent process to child workers
- **`Section.accessory`** throws a clear error when missing
- **`roles.delete`** no longer incorrectly returns a Role object
- **Locale router** handles undefined `lang` gracefully

---

## Upgrade

```bash
pnpm install seyfert@3.2.0
```

No breaking changes. Just improvements.

Sometimes that's exactly what you need.
