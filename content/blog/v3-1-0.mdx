## A Speedrun Release

Discord announced Components v2 with almost no warning. We had to move fast.

**2 days later, here we are.** Full support for Discord's new UI primitives.

Thanks for nothing, Discord. Thanks for everything, Seyfert team. ❤️

## What Are Components v2?

Discord's original components — buttons, select menus, modals — were revolutionary. But they had limits. Want a rich layout? Multiple sections? Thumbnails? You were out of luck.

**Components v2 changes everything.** These aren't just new components; they're a new way to structure message content.

## The New Components

### Container

The foundation. Containers hold other components and define the layout structure:

```ts
new Container()
  .addComponents(section, separator, mediaGallery)
```

### Section

Group related content with text and an accessory (thumbnail or button):

```ts
new Section()
  .addComponents(
    new TextDisplay().setContent("**Product Name**"),
    new TextDisplay().setContent("$29.99")
  )
  .setAccessory(thumbnail)
```

### TextDisplay

Rich text content within sections:

```ts
new TextDisplay()
  .setContent("This is **bold** and this is *italic*")
```

### Thumbnail

Small images that sit alongside section content:

```ts
new Thumbnail()
  .setMedia("https://example.com/image.png")
```

### MediaGallery

Display multiple images in a beautiful gallery layout:

```ts
new MediaGallery()
  .addItems(
    new MediaGalleryItem().setMedia(image1),
    new MediaGalleryItem().setMedia(image2)
  )
```

### File

Attach files directly within your component layout:

```ts
new File()
  .setMedia("attachment://report.pdf")
```

### Separator

Visual dividers between sections:

```ts
new Separator()
  .setSpacing(Spacing.Small)
  .setDivider(true)
```

## Why This Matters

Before Components v2, rich Discord bot UIs required creative workarounds — embedding images, using multiple embeds, or accepting limitations.

Now you can build:
- **Product catalogs** with thumbnails and descriptions
- **Dashboards** with organized data sections
- **Media galleries** for image-heavy content
- **Document layouts** with proper visual hierarchy

The gap between "bot message" and "real application" just got much smaller.

## Hook Into the Pipeline

New lifecycle hooks give you more control over interaction processing:

```ts
class MyCommand extends Command {
  onBeforeMiddlewares(ctx: Context) {
    // Runs before any middleware
    console.log('Command received:', ctx.commandName);
  }

  onBeforeOptions(ctx: Context) {
    // Runs before option parsing
    return { customData: true };
  }
}
```

Perfect for logging, analytics, or custom preprocessing.

## Fixes

- **`editOrReply`** now properly accepts flags, enabling v2 components in edit operations

## Performance

- Fixed a critical performance issue causing high CPU usage when iterating `cache.members.values()` on large guilds

---

## Get Started

```bash
pnpm install seyfert@3.1.0
```

Then dive into the [Components v2 documentation](/guide/components/v2) to start building next-gen UIs.

Discord's UI toolkit just evolved. So did yours.
