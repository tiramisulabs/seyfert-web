## Modals Just Got Superpowers

Remember when modals were just... text inputs? Those days are over.

Discord has completely reimagined what modals can do, and **Seyfert v4.0.0** brings you the full experience. File uploads. Select menus. Rich text displays. The humble modal is now a complete data collection powerhouse.

## The New Modal Architecture

### Label: The New Foundation

Here's the breaking change you need to know: **Modals now use `Label` instead of `ActionRow`**.

Think of `Label` as the evolution of ActionRow, specifically designed for the modal context. It's not just a rename — it enables the new component types that weren't possible before.

```ts
// Before (v3.x)
new Modal()
  .addComponents(
    new ActionRow().addComponents(textInput)
  )

// After (v4.0)
new Modal()
  .addComponents(
    new Label().setComponent(textInput),
    new Label().setComponent(fileUpload),
    new Label().setComponent(selectMenu)
  )
```

Every component in a modal now lives inside a `Label`. This is the foundation for everything else.

---

## File Uploads in Modals

This is the one everyone's been waiting for.

Users can now upload files directly through modals. Forms, submissions, reports — anything that needs an attachment is now possible without awkward workarounds.

```ts
const modal = new Modal()
  .setTitle('Submit Your Report')
  .setCustomId('report-modal')
  .addComponents(
    new Label().setLabel('Describe the issue')
    .setComponent(
      new TextInput()
        .setCustomId('description')
        .setStyle(TextInputStyle.Paragraph)
    ),
    new Label().setLabel('Attach a screenshot')
    .setComponent(
      new FileUpload()
        .setCustomId('screenshot')
    )
  );
```

Retrieving the files is just as clean:

```ts
async run(ctx: ModalContext) {
  const files = ctx.interaction.getFiles();
  
  for (const file of files) {
    console.log(`Received: ${file.filename} (${file.size} bytes)`);
    // Process the uploaded file
  }
}
```

Build bug report systems, application forms, content submission workflows — the possibilities just expanded dramatically.

## Select Menus Everywhere

All select menu types now work inside modals:

```ts
new Modal()
  .addComponents(
    new Label().setComponent(
      new StringSelectMenu()
        .setCustomId('category')
        .setPlaceholder('Select a category')
        .addOptions(
          { label: 'Bug Report', value: 'bug' },
          { label: 'Feature Request', value: 'feature' },
          { label: 'Question', value: 'question' }
        )
    ),
    new Label().setComponent(
      new UserSelectMenu()
        .setCustomId('assign-to')
        .setPlaceholder('Assign to a team member')
    )
  )
```

String selects, user selects, role selects, channel selects, mentionable selects — they all work. Mix and match to create powerful data collection forms.

---

## Rich Text in Modals

`TextDisplay` components can now appear inside modals via `Label`:

```ts
new Label().setComponent(
  new TextDisplay()
    .setContent('**Important:** Please read our guidelines before submitting.')
)
```

Add instructions, warnings, or formatting to guide users through your modal flows.

---

## Enhancements

### Smarter Guild Listing

`guilds.list()` now returns properly typed results based on your parameters (cached or not):

No more type assertions. The types just work.

### Raw Message Access

Need the untouched Discord data? We've got you:

```ts
const raw = await channel.messages.raw(messageId);
// API response or cached object — no Seyfert transformations
```

Perfect for debugging, accessing fields we don't expose, or when you need the data exactly as Discord (or the cache) stores it.

### Edit Your Bio

`CurrentGuildMember` now supports bio editing:

```ts
await ctx.member.edit({
  bio: 'Bot developed with Seyfert'
});
```

Yes, bots can have bios now. Make yours count.

---

## Gateway Rate Limit Event

A new event you'll probably never see — but it's there if you need it:

```ts title="events/gatewayRateLimit.ts"
import { createEvent } from 'seyfert';

export default createEvent({
  data: { name: 'gatewayRateLimit' },
  run(info, client) {
    client.logger.warn('Gateway rate limited:', info);
  }
});
```

Discord emits this if you send more than 2 `guild_member_request` calls with an empty query within 1 minute. Seyfert's gateway handling makes this nearly impossible to trigger, but transparency matters.

## Breaking Changes

| Change | Migration |
|--------|-----------|
| Modals use `Label` instead of `ActionRow` | Replace `ActionRow` with `Label` in all modal code |

That's it. One breaking change. The migration is straightforward — find and replace `ActionRow` with `Label` in your modal builders.

---

## Upgrade

```bash
pnpm install seyfert@4.0.0
```

Modals were always useful. Now they're unstoppable.

Welcome to Seyfert v4.
