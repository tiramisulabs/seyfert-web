title: "Seyfert v2.1.0: Scaling Without Limits"
description: Automatic resharding, smarter workers, and the infrastructure your growing bot deserves.

## Built for Growth

Your bot is growing. What started as a fun project now serves thousands of servers. Suddenly, you're hitting rate limits, managing shards manually, and wondering if there's a better way.

There is. **Seyfert v2.1.0** brings enterprise-grade scaling features that just work.

---

## The Headline: Automatic Resharding

As your bot joins more servers, Discord requires more shards. Previously, this meant downtime — restart your bot, reconfigure shards, pray nothing breaks.

Not anymore. **Resharding is now automatic and enabled by default.** Seyfert monitors your bot's growth and seamlessly adjusts shard count in real-time. No downtime. No manual intervention. Your bot scales while you sleep.

## New Features

### Entry Point Interactions

Discord's new Entry Point feature lets users discover your bot's commands directly from the app directory. We've added full support:

- `EntryPointInteraction` — Handle entry point triggers
- `EntryPointContext` — Rich context for entry point commands  
- `EntryPointCommand` — Define entry point behavior declaratively

### Smarter Worker Architecture

Running Seyfert with workers? We've made significant improvements:

- **Spawn Queue** — Workers now spawn in a controlled sequence, preventing resource spikes
- **`WORKER_SHARD_CONNECTED` Event** — Know exactly when each worker's shards are ready
- **Better Error Logging** — Shards now log errors without requiring debug mode

### Subscription Events

Building premium features? Track subscription lifecycles with new events:

- `SUBSCRIPTION_CREATE`
- `SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE`  
- `SUBSCRIPTION_DELETE`

Perfect for managing premium tiers, sending welcome messages to new subscribers, or handling cancellations gracefully.

### Quality of Life

- New `AnyContext` type for functions that accept any command context
- Improved rate limit handling with proper HTTP 429 responses

## Breaking Changes

A few small adjustments for a cleaner API:

### Attachment Filename

```diff
interface AttachmentData {
-  name: string;
+  filename: string;
}
```

The property name now matches Discord's API terminology.

### WorkerClient Event Forwarding

For performance, `WorkerClient` no longer sends all events to the parent `WorkerManager` by default. Enable it explicitly if needed:

```ts
new WorkerClient({
  sendPayloadToParent: true
});
```

### Cache Configuration

The `disabledCache` option in `WorkerClient` has been removed. Use `setServices` instead for consistent configuration across all client types.

---

## Upgrade Guide

```bash
pnpm install seyfert@2.1.0
```

1. Update any `AttachmentData` references from `name` to `filename`
2. If using `WorkerClient` with event forwarding, add `sendPayloadToParent: true`
3. Migrate any `disabledCache` options to `setServices`

That's it. Your bot is now ready to scale infinitely.
